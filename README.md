The fermat primality test is being implemented in FermatTest.java.
It is being tested in Tests.java, some of the output is being converted into scientific
notation for readability.

Finding large primes:

When looking for primes the amount of bits didn’t seem to matter as the number of candidates tried until a prime was found varied from 10’s to 100’s for both. Basically every time we rerun the test the amount of candidates changed with no noticeable pattern.

We aren't 100% sure what it means by "Record... the number of candidates a for each random candidate, and the average number of operations per candidate a". We did our best to answer this but aren't quite sure if its what you're looking for.
